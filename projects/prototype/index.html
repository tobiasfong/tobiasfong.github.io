      <h1>Notes from a humanities major learning to code</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        At Aleph, I work with people who build things for a living. I’m learning to build too, one
        page at a time. This is the messier, more honest version.

          We are in the process of entering a new era, where coding is done by AI, rather than by
          human hands. This is not to say that human developers are no longer needed. It simply
          allows us humanities majors to close the gap and be more versatile rather than living
          within our own bubbles.

          This blog is evidence that anyone can become a coder. A computer science degree gives you
          an advantage, but it doesn’t mean the door is closed to the rest of us. AI brings fresh
          opportunities, but it is not omnipotent. Humans are still necessary for flexibility,
          judgement, and asking well.
