          We are in the process of entering a new era, where coding is done by AI, rather than by human hands.
          This is not to say that human developers are no longer needed, but rather, we can focus on creativity now that we have AI to assist us with mundane tasks.
          Nor am I claiming computer science degrees have become obsolete.
          It simply allows us humanities majors to close the gap and be more versatile rather than living within our own bubbles.

         This blog is evidence that anyone can become a coder.
          The computer science degree will undoubtedly give you an advantage, but that doesn't mean the door to development is closed to the rest of us.
          AI brings with it fresh and exciting opportunities, and we should learn to take advantage of it instead of fearing it.
          Nonetheless, we must also be on our guard against complacency.
          AI is useful, but it is not omnipotent.
          Humans are still necessary for content creation and other tasks that require flexibility.
          AI also requires prompts, and that's where we come in.
